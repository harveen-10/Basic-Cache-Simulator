# Cache Mapping Algorithms

This repository contains C++ implementations of two cache mapping algorithms:
1. Direct Mapping
2. Fully Associative Mapping



## Direct Mapping

The `directmapping.cpp` file implements the direct mapping algorithm. It includes functions to convert decimal numbers to binary, perform cache mapping using direct mapping, and display cache contents.

To run the program:
```bash
g++ direct_map.cpp -o direct_map
./direct_map



## Fully Associative Mapping

The `fullyassociative.cpp` file implements the fully associative mapping algorithm. It includes functions for FIFO and LRU (Least Recently Used) replacement policies, cache mapping using fully associative mapping, and displaying cache contents.

To run the program:
```bash
g++ fully_associative.cpp -o fully_associative
./fully_associative
